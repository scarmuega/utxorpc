        <PackageDescription>
            UTxO RPC (u5c for short) is an interface tailored for interactions with UTxO-based blockchains, prioritizing performance and developer experience. By providing a common contract, a range of SDKs, and thorough documentation, UTxO RPC aims to facilitate:
            .
            * Reusability: Enabling shared components that can be reused across different projects to simplify the integration effort.
            * Interoperability: A common interface to simplify integrations between different parties and avoid the common pitfall of vendor lock-in.
            * Performance: A serialized binary format which is compact and efficient, resulting in smaller message sizes and reduced network overhead compared to its JSON counterpart
            .
            Please note that UTxO RPC is just a specification of an interface between agents and the blockchain, it doesn't provide any concrete client / provider implementations. The primary purpose of u5c is to define a set of standardized methods, data structures, and communication patterns.
